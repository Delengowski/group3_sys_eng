  abstract={A group of geographically dispersed and logically collaborated emergency organizations are involved when emergency occurs. Two challenging issues are a reasonable emergency resource allocation mechanism and an efficient resource conflict checking and resolution control mechanism to ensure the conflict-free execution of global cross-organization emergency response processes. To address them, this paper proposes an approach to support emergency resource management including both intraorganization private resource management and cross-organization public resource management. The former has been fully discussed in our previous work using E-net. To cope with the latter, this paper presents a novel type of Petri net that is extended with both time and resource factors to model cross-organization emergency response processes. Then, according to the resource requirement analysis, their worst, delayed, and best cases are obtained. Next, emergency resource conflict checking and four conflict resolution strategies are proposed to resolve the detected resource conflicts for the delayed execution case. This paper shows how to use different resolution strategies to construct the conflict-free model by designing corresponding resolution controllers. Finally, their performance is evaluated by a fire emergency response example.},
