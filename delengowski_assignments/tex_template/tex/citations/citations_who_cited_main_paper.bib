  abstract={The fault diagnosis problem in discrete event systems consists in detecting the occurrences of faults in a plant, which is essential for ensuring the reliability of the plant. In the literature, this problem has been widely studied by assuming that the communications between a plant and a diagnostic agent, i.e., a diagnoser, are reliable and instantaneous. However, for a networked system, the information generated by a plant is transmitted through a shared communication network such that communication delays and losses are inevitable. This article formulates and studies the fault diagnosis problem in networked discrete event systems (NDESs) modeled by labeled Petri nets, where communication delays and losses are considered. Such a problem is also called robust fault diagnosis in this article. An important notion closely related to robust diagnosis, named networked diagnosability, is introduced, indicating that any occurred fault in a NDES is definitely determined after a limited number of observations. For a NDES, a tool called a networked basis diagnoser is excogitated to solve the robust diagnosis problem. A necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the networked diagnosability of a plant is derived by using the developed diagnoser. Finally, a manufacturing system is presented to illustrate the developed approach.},

  abstract={Emergency response is any systematic response to unexpected events that pose potential risk and/or damage to human life or property. Outbreak of virus, leak of poisonous chemicals, and terrorist attack are just a few examples. The goal of emergency response is to minimize the adverse impact of an incident to society and the environment. To guarantee the implementation of its handling procedure, adequate resources must be available. The success of emergency response also relies on the timeliness of related rescue actions. This paper presents resource-oriented timed workflow nets for the modeling and analysis of the resource requirements in responding to an emergency incident, as well as the time required to complete prescribed response tasks. This new model provides a formal basis for process designers and practitioners to examine the readiness and efficiency of their emergency plans. The presented algorithm can be applied to workflows with sequential, concurrent, decision-making and repetitive structures. A case study on chemical spill response is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model.},

  abstract={There exist a variety of resource conflicts due to resource constraints in production lines during the period of renewal of sophisticated products manufacturing, probably leading to production delays and resource wastage. With respect to the resource conflicts of the resource-constrained multiproject scheduling problem in sophisticated product lines, we construct a multiproject production line resource conflict resolution model, design a feedback regulation, and a hybrid genetic algorithm based on the cooperative game negotiation mechanism, which covers four stages starting from the manufacturer receiving the orders of original and upgraded products, taking into account of resource reallocation, resource sharing, and seeking help from emergency suppliers, to respond highly to the dynamics of customer orders and optimize production systems, achieving intelligent advances. The case results show that the proposed method can save up to 77.84% of the delay and scheduling cost, and these savings can allow the manufacturer to increase profits by 10.82% due to shortening the production delay. The current work not only helps manufacturers of sophisticated products to improve their production efficiencies and reduce delay cost but also provides a certain basis for future managers to make production management decisions.},

  volume={17},

  pages={142-155},
  abstract={Process discovery aims to extract descriptive process models from event logs. To date, various process discovery algorithms have been proposed for different application settings. However, most of them meet challenges in handling event logs produced from hierarchical multi-instance business processes, in which multiple sub-process instances are invoked by the execution of a parent process. To address the problem, a novel approach is presented to support the discovery of hierarchical multi-instance process models. Specifically, taking event logs with multi-instance information as input, the detailed implementation of our method can be generally divided into four steps: nesting relation detection, hierarchical event log construction, sub-process case identification, and hierarchical multi-instance model discovery. We have implemented our approach properly as plugins in the openly accessible ProM toolkit, and compared its performance against the state-of-the-art process discovery approaches over six publicly available event logs. Based on the experimental result, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively discover hierarchical multi-instance process models with better quality.},

  year={2024},
  volume={54},

  pages={800-812},
  abstract={When an emergency occurs, disposal needs to be built to reduce the risk imposed on life, property, and environment. Generally, the disposal is organized as a cross-organization emergency response process (CERP). To achieve better-emergency response services, its correctness analysis is an important task that needs to be dealt with at design time. In this article, we propose a novel correctness analysis approach for CERPs. Given a CERP, this approach first decomposes it into a set of instance nets. Then, it excludes the invalid instance nets (each corresponds to an incomplete process instance) and adopts the stubborn set to check the structural correctness of each valid instance net without considering resource factors, as well as introduces a structure-based resource analysis (SRA) method to determine whether the resources in it are sufficient. Finally, it determines the correctness of the CERP by comparing the numbers of the correct instance nets and all valid instance nets. If the CERP is incorrect, it returns the correct instance nets, which capture the parts of the CERP that can be executed correctly. This approach is evaluated on an actual data set, and the comparison results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

  pages={2160-2172},
  abstract={Given the differences of command and control (C2) activities between the field command center and the emergency operations center (EOC), this article combined the edge C2 theory with the parallel C2 theory, and proposed a parallel incident C2 mode based on the observe–orient–decide–act (OODA) loop and planning–readiness–execution–assessment (PREA) loop. The aim is to build up a PREA loop-based parallel incident C2 mode and its related operating mechanism of edge empowerment and energy release in parallel incident C2 mode. The parallel incident C2 mode based on the PREA loop and OODA loop supports the co-existence and connection of the two roles of the incident C2 agent at the emergency scene. The two roles are the executive role of emergency response and operation and the command and organization role of the edge emergency system. This article initiates a deep integration of two different C2 process mechanisms in the emergency response and operation process, taking into account the local emergency scene and the global emergency system. Taken together, a key issue has been well addressed regarding the contradiction that the traditional emergency response cannot be reconciled in terms of rapidity and thoroughness.},

  abstract={Business processes are critical for information systems to control workflows and deliver services. Although existing process discovery techniques can generate flat process models from business event logs, few of them have investigated the notion of hierarchy (i.e., subprocesses) yet. To fill the gap, this article first defines the concept of hierarchical Petri nets (HPNs), which can support the formal modeling and correctness verification of processes with subprocesses. Followed by that, we propose an approach which can effectively discover HPNs from event logs with lifecycle information. Moreover, to quantify the quality of discovered HPNs, details on how to transform an HPN to a classical Petri net are given such that existing metrics can be applied. All proposed approaches have been fully implemented in ProM, and experiments over both synthetic and real-life event logs demonstrate that our approach can effectively discover hierarchical process models. Specifically, compared to exiting approaches on processes discovery, our approach can generally perform better in terms of model quality.},

  title={Cross-Department Collaborative Healthcare Process Model Discovery From Event Logs}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={20},

  pages={2115-2125},
  abstract={Healthcare plays an increasingly essential role in our daily life. Modern Hospital Information Systems (HISs) record and store detailed medical treatment process information for all patients as event logs. By taking event logs as input, process mining techniques have been widely applied to extract valuable insights to improve medical treatment processes and deliver better healthcare services. However, considering the complexity of collaborations among different medical departments, existing model discovery techniques cannot be applied directly. To handle this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach to support the discovery of Cross-department Collaborative Healthcare Process (CCHP) models from medical event logs. Specifically, an extension of classical Petri Nets with message and resource attributes is first introduced to formalize CCHPs. Then, a novel discovery algorithm is proposed to discover Intra-department Healthcare Process (IHP) models. Next, collaboration patterns among medical departments are formalized and corresponding discovery algorithms are given on that basis. Finally, a global CCHP model is obtained by integrating all discovered collaboration patterns and IHP models. By using four public medical event logs, we quantitatively compare our approach with the state-of-the-art process mining techniques in terms of model quality, and our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover more accurate healthcare process models. Note to Practitioners—The recorded medical event logs by HISs can be used to extract valuable insights for the analysis of healthcare processes. However, existing process model discovery techniques cannot be applied for the analysis directly due to the complex collaborations among different medical departments of a hospital. This paper introduces a novel approach for cross-department collaborative healthcare process model discovery from medical event logs. All proposed techniques are fully implemented and publicly available. Using four public medical event logs, we show the applicability and advantages of our approach against existing ones. The proposed techniques are applicable to the model discovery and behavior understanding of real-life operational healthcare processes.},

  title={Design of Optimal Supervisors for the Enforcement of Nonlinear Constraints on Petri Nets}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={1},
  pages={611-623},
  abstract={This paper proposes an iterative approach to separate a set of admissible markings of a nonlinear constraint into a number of subsets. At each iteration, we find a maximal subset of admissible markings that are separated from inadmissible markings by linear constraints. Then, the union of all the obtained subsets constitutes the set of all admissible markings. For each subset of admissible markings, we obtain a set of conjunctive linear constraints. Accordingly, we can equivalently transform a given nonlinear constraint to be a set of disjunctive/conjunctive linear constraints, which can deal with the case that both admissible and inadmissible marking spaces of a nonlinear constraint cannot be separated by linear constraints from each other. Furthermore, we propose a method to design a Petri net supervisor for a derived set of disjunctive/conjunctive constraints. Some examples are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—Linear constraints on Petri nets have been widely studied in the literature. However, not all control specifications can be represented as linear constraints. This paper proposes to enforce nonlinear constraints on Petri nets. A maximally permissive supervisor is designed to make the controlled net live with all admissible markings with respect to a given nonlinear constraint. Meanwhile, the structural complexity is also considered by compressing the number of control places in the supervisor. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can implement the control specifications represented by nonlinear constraints.},

  abstract={Process discovery, as one of the most challenging process analysis techniques, aims to uncover business process models from event logs. Many process discovery approaches were invented in the past twenty years; however, most of them have difficulties in handling multi-instance sub-processes. To address this challenge, we first introduce a multi-instance business process model (MBPM) to support the modeling of processes with multiple sub-process instantiations. Formal semantics of MBPMs are precisely defined by using multi-instance Petri nets (MPNs) that are an extension of Petri nets with distinguishable tokens. Then, a novel process discovery technique is developed to support the discovery of MBPMs from event logs with sub-process multi-instantiation information. In addition, we propose to measure the quality of the discovered MBPMs against the input event logs by transforming an MBPM to a classical Petri net such that existing quality metrics, e.g., fitness and precision, can be used. The proposed discovery approach is properly implemented as plugins in the ProM toolkit. Based on a cloud resource management case study, we compare our approach with the state-of-the-art process discovery techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches to discover process models with multi-instance sub-processes.},

  abstract={A large amount of research has shown the vitality of siphon enumeration in the analysis and control of deadlocks in various resource-allocation systems modeled by Petri nets (PNs). In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the enumeration of minimal siphons in PN based on problem decomposition. The proposed algorithm is an improved version of the global partitioning minimal-siphon enumeration (GPMSE) proposed by Cordone et al. (2005) in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, which is widely used in the literature to compute minimal siphons. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm consumes lower computational time and memory compared with GPMSE, which becomes more evident when the size of the handled net grows.},

  abstract={Business process similarity measures are of vital importance for process repository management applications, such as process query, process recommendation, and process clustering. Most existing approaches measure process similarity by relying on control-flow structures only. This article investigates the role of data in process similarity measure. To incorporate data-flow information into business process control flow, it proposes a data-aware workflow net (DWF-net) by extending the classical workflow net with data reading and writing semantics. Then, we introduce three types of similarity measures, i.e., data item set-based similarity, data operation set-based similarity, and data-aware behavior-based similarity, to quantify the similarity of data-aware business processes from different perspectives. Next, a methodology is introduced to help process analysts apply these three measures in a systematical way. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed similarity measures by a group of comparative experiments. Note to Practitioners—Business process similarity measures play an increasingly important role in business process repository management. This work addresses the role of data for process similarity measures. To this end, three types of similarity measures, i.e., data item set-based similarity, data operation set-based similarity, and data-aware behavior-based similarity, are introduced to quantify the similarity of data-aware business processes from different perspectives. By comparative evaluation, the effectiveness and applicability are demonstrated. The proposed methodology is readily applicable to enterprise process repository management problems.},

  abstract={Collaborative business processes gather a set of business processes with complementary competencies and knowledge to cooperate to achieve more business successes. To ensure their successful implementation, correctness is a key issue that needs to be addressed during their development. To this end, a novel correctness enforcement approach is proposed to support the development of collaborative business processes. In this approach, we first give an algorithm to check the correctness of an original process specified by Petri nets. Then, we prune its reachability graph to obtain its core in case of partially correct, which is a reduced reachability graph that doesn't cover invalid states. Finally, we generate a set of controllers from the core using coordination mapping (i.e., inserting some coordination activities into controllers), and then an enforced process is built by the composition of the original process and the controllers. Our approach is implemented as an analysis module called cetool in the PIPE (Platform Independent Petri Net Editor) and it is validated on a set of real-world cases. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The ongoing digital transformation and internationalization of business processes cause a shift towards a more collaborative nature of processes. In such collaborations, different organizations execute separate parts of the process autonomously. This fragmentation leads to uncertainty regarding the correct execution of activities, the proper workflow, and data in the process flow. If organizations engage in business together, trust is needed. Therefore, we propose Trust Mining as an analytical approach to better understand uncertainties and the potential trust issues that arise from them. Trust Mining takes a business process model as an input and analyzes uncertainties and relationships. In the end, an evaluation regarding the trust requirements of specific stakeholders is given. Furthermore, we present a prototypical implementation and illustrate how Trust Mining can be used in trust-aware process (re-)design.},

  abstract={Tremendous amounts of execution data are collected during software execution. These data provide rich information for software runtime behavior comprehension. The unstructured execution data may be too complex, involving multiple interleaved components and so on. Applying existing process discovery techniques results in spaghetti-like models with no clear structure and no valuable information that can be easily understood by end users. In this article, we start with the observation that a software system is composed of a group of components, and we use this information to decompose the problem into smaller independent ones by discovering a behavioral model per component. To this end, we first distill a software event log for each component from the raw software execution data. Then, we construct the hierarchical software event log by recursively applying caller-and-callee relation detection. Next, component behavioral models, represented as hierarchical Petri nets, are discovered by recursively applying existing process discovery techniques. To measure the quality of discovered models against the execution data, we transform hierarchical Petri nets to flat ones, and the quality metrics, e.g., fitness, precision, and complexity, are applied. All proposed approaches have been implemented in the open-source process mining toolkit ProM. Through the experimental evaluation using both synthetic software systems and open-source software systems, we illustrate that the proposed approach facilitates the discovery of more understandable and high-quality software behavioral models. Note to Practitioners—Software execution data record rich information on the runtime behavior of software systems. Discovering an overall behavioral model for the whole software system typically results in an extremely complicated model that hinders further comprehension and usage. With the observation that a software system is composed of a set of interacting components, this article considers the problem of discovering a behavioral model per component. The proposed techniques are implemented in the open-source process mining tool ProM, and experimental evaluations using both synthetic and real-life software systems have indicated their applicability. The proposed approaches are readily applicable to industrial-size software behavior comprehension.},
